# ML_CNN_Models
This is a Computer Vision (CV) task in deep learning, using Convolutional  Neural Network (CNN) backbone models to address image classification problems

## Training the Model
The dataset must be placed in a folder called "Colorectal Cancer"
under the root of this project. Within that are sub-folders 
called MUS, NORM, etc.
